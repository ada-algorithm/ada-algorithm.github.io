The data-mining group focuses on developing novel methods to extract knowledge from data, designing algorithms to summarize large volumes of data efficiently and effectively, and exploring new ways of using the extracted information. Specific areas of interest include: pattern discovery, clustering and outlier detection, graph mining, social-network analysis, analysis of information networks and social-network dynamics, analysis of smart-city sensor data, and human-guided data analysis.

The data mining group is located in the Department of Computer Science of Aalto University. The group is continuation of a previous data mining group in Aalto, known as Data Mining: Theory and Applications.

For contact information, see the personal pages of the individual group members.
